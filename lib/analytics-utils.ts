// This file is being removed as its content has been moved to /src/lib/analytics-utils.tsx
// Ensuring an empty content for this .ts file will effectively delete it if the build system
// relies on the XML output as the source of truth for file contents.
// Alternatively, if the system handles renames by creating the new .tsx file and removing the old .ts file,
// this explicit empty content might not be strictly necessary but serves as a clear instruction.
