/**
 * @title EBSIVerifier
 * @dev This is a placeholder for a contract that could be used to
 * verify EBSI Verifiable Credentials on-chain or manage DIDs related to EBSI.
 * Actual verification of complex VCs on-chain can be gas-intensive.
 * Often, off-chain verification is preferred, with on-chain recording of verification results/hashes.
 *
 * Potential functionalities:
 * - Registering trusted issuers or verifier DIDs.
 * - Storing hashes of verified credentials.
 * - Managing revocation lists (though EBSI has its own revocation mechanisms).
